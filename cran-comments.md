Dear Reviewers:

I build this package using [R CMD build .] and checked is with command [R CMD check --as-cran rglobi_0.2.5.tar.gz] on my Mac OS X (v 10.9.5) machine running R  3.1.2 . Also, the checks were executed on travis-ci.org (running Ubuntu) and winbuilder (running windows). 

Fixes:
* Removed invalid assumption in tests. This invalid assumption caused errors in the cran report. 

The remaining note for this version is:
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
