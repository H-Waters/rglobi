Dear Reviewers:

I built this package using [R CMD build .] and checked it with command [R CMD check --as-cran rglobi_0.2.10.tar.gz] on my Ubuntu Xenial (4.4.0-93-generic) machine running R 3.4.1 . Also, the checks were executed on travis-ci.org (running Ubuntu) and winbuilder (running windows). 

Improvement:
* a rglobi user requested to search by interactions type (see https://github.com/ropensci/rglobi/issues/23). The functionality was implemented by adding method ```get_interactions_by_type```.

The remaining note for this version is:
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
