Dear Reviewers:

I built this package using [R CMD build .] and checked it with command [R CMD check --as-cran rglobi_0.2.25.tar.gz] on my Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Bionic Beaver (4.15.0-153-generic) machine running R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18) . Also, the checks were executed on travis-ci.org (running Ubuntu), github workflows (windows/mac/ubuntu), and winbuilder (running windows). 

IMPROVEMENT
* added section on returnobservations=T in getting started vignette as suggested by @ZekeMarshall in https://github.com/ropensci/rglobi/issues/38#issuecomment-897603331 .

I've checked the mis-spelled words and confirmed that they are in fact not mis-spelled. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission.
