Dear Reviewers:

I built this package using [R CMD build .] and checked it with command [R CMD check --as-cran rglobi_0.2.27.tar.gz] on my Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Bionic Beaver (4.15.0-159-generic) machine running R 4.1.1 (2021-08-10). Also, the checks were executed on travis-ci.com (running Ubuntu), github workflows (windows/mac/ubuntu), and winbuilder (running windows). 

IMPROVEMENT
* improve test cases to skip with message if web apis are unavailable

I've checked the mis-spelled words and confirmed that they are in fact not mis-spelled. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission.
