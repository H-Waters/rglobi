Dear Reviewers:

I built this package using [R CMD build .] and checked it with command [R CMD check --as-cran rglobi_0.2.28.tar.gz] on my Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Focal Fossa (4.15.0-159-generic) machine running R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23). 

IMPROVEMENT
* Adding warning message when query generates more results than can be returned. Big thanks for Helen Waters for their contributions @H-Waters https://github.com/H-Waters via https://github.com/ropensci/rglobi/pull/45
* update NEWS format

I've checked the mis-spelled words and confirmed that they are in fact not mis-spelled. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission.
