Dear Reviewers:

I built this package using [R CMD build .] and checked it with command [R CMD check --as-cran rglobi_0.2.25.tar.gz] on my Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Bionic Beaver (4.15.0-135-generic) machine running R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31) . Also, the checks were executed on travis-ci.org (running Ubuntu), github workflows (windows/mac/ubuntu), and winbuilder (running windows). 

IMPROVEMENT
* minor changes by @jimhester (thanks Jim!) to prepare for readr 2.0.0 release via https://github.com/ropensci/rglobi/pull/37 .
* replace broken url http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/ with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System .

I've checked the mis-spelled words and confirmed that they are in fact not mis-spelled. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission.
