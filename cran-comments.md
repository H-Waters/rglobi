Dear Reviewers:

I built this package using [R CMD build .] and checked it with command [R CMD check --as-cran rglobi_0.2.22.tar.gz] on my Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Bionic Beaver (4.15.0-135-generic) machine running R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31) . Also, the checks were executed on travis-ci.org (running Ubuntu), github workflows (windows/mac/ubuntu), and winbuilder (running windows). 

IMPROVEMENT
* include markdown package in DESCRIPTION suggests as suggested by https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1864

I've checked the mis-spelled words and confirmed that they are in fact not mis-spelled. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission.
